# C-Gym-Envs
Repository containing C++ classes that can be bound to Python using pybind11, and then used in Gymnasium environments for Deep Reinforcement Learning. Some environments may contain loops that we do not want to implement in Python.

To install, clone the repository, then clone the pybind11 repository into the resulting folder, then `pip install -e <path to folder containing setup.py>`
